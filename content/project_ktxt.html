            TXT allows users to interact through a global chat. Users will be required to register an account and login in order to send messages and add other users as friends 
            (however the global chat can still be spectated regardless of login status). Users gain score by being the first to type the word sent by the server.

            Kinetik TXT utilised various architectures.
            <br><br>
            Frontend (Presentation Tier) <br>
            The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. EJS is the templating engine which I used to generate content dynamically and condense code.
            <br><br>
            Backend (Application Tier) <br>
            The backend was developed using Node.js and Express.js. It authenticates users, interacts with the database and deals with requests.
            <br><br>
            Communication <br>
            Socket.io was used to achieve real time bidirectional communication between the server and clients via websockets. It is also compatible with express-session.
            <br><br>
            Database (Data Tier) <br>
            mySQL is used as the relational database to store data (user data, friendships and useful procedures)
            <br><br>
            Security <br>
            Bcrypt is used to hash user passwords and express-validator, express-sanitizer and validator were used for data validation / sanitation.
